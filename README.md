# material_design_tkinter
I'm not planning to go all out at this point, this just gives me something to practice Python as I learn.  
I am creating a button in tkinter's canvas that has a variable drop shadow according to the height, z order, of the items.  
I will try to include a raised button transition effect on mouseover.  
I may try to add a ripple effect further down the road.  
If I get this to work decently, then I'll see about recreating other items.  
Feel free to tag along, if you're already a programmer, you'll likely need to add addtional comments so I can follow along easier.
